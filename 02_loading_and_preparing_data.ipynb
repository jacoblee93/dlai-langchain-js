    "# Loading and preparing data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we learned how to construct a chain with LCEL. Now that we have those fundamentals down, we'll continue on our journey to construct a \"chat with data\" application by going over some techniques to store our own documents for later retrieval to ground the LLM's generation in our own context. This is generally called Retrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic flow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load documents from a source.\n",
    "2. Split the docs into chunks small enough to fit into an LLM's context window and avoid distraction.\n",
    "3. Embed the chunks in a vectorstore to allow for later retrieval based on input queries.\n",
    "4. Retrieval of relevant previously-split chunks.\n",
    "5. Generating a final output with retrieved chunks as context.\n",
    "\n",

    "We'll cover the first two steps in this lesson.\n",

    "## Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need some source documents to start. LangChain includes many other document loaders for many sources of data.\n",
